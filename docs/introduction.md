Introduction
============

Welcome to the Nexus-CAT Python package documentation. Nexus-CAT is a **Cluster Analysis Toolkit** designed for analyzing clusters in atomistic simulation trajectories. It provides tools to calculate percolation properties, cluster sizes, gyration radii, and more.

### Key Features

- **Cluster Analysis**: Analyze clusters based on connectivity and percolation theory.
- **Percolation Properties**: Calculate properties like average cluster size, spanning cluster size, and correlation length.
- **Extensibility**: Easily add new extensions for different systems and cluster connectivities.
- **Visualization**: Generate detailed outputs for further analysis and visualization.

### Project Goals

The goal of Nexus-CAT is to provide a user-friendly, efficient, and flexible toolkit for researchers working with atomistic simulations. It supports various extensions for analyzing different systems and cluster connectivities.
